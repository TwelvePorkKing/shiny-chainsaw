Hello World!
I'm Twelve Pork King, the guy who is curious about the world.
I want to learn sth without someone forces me, tutor me all the time, yeah, in morden era, I want to cooperate with the guys who are unfamiliar to me and learn from the Internet or books.

In fact, computer language is the third language of humankind. It can help us understand the world in a unique angle, besides, I think the repetitive behaviors should be programmed so that we may take valuable time to think and do more interesting.

That's great, isn't it?

Also, through the GitHub I can improve my English level and make friends with you(If you're intersted in me or my contents), afterall, maybe the encouragement from each other is the most precious thing in this world.

Now, let's go!

well, I have tried for many times to commit, what it would be like?
